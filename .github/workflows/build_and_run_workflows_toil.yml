# NOTE: For some reason, running the workflows with toil-cwl-runner takes
# almost exactly twice as much time as cwltool. Since we do not want to triple
# our CI time on every push, for now let's just run toil-cwl-runner separately
# every weekday at midnight.

on:
  # push:  # Do NOT run toil-cwl-runner on every push!
  # pull_request: (either on origin or on upstream pull request)
  schedule:
  # Instead, run it every weekday at midnight.
    - cron: '0 0 * * 1-5'

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash -l {0} # Invoke bash in login mode, NOT interactive mode.
    # This will cause bash to look for the startup file ~/.bash_profile, NOT ~/.bashrc
    # This is important since conda init writes to ~/.bashrc
