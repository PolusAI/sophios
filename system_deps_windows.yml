name: wic

channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults

dependencies:
# pypy is ~2X faster than the regular python interpreter.
# We need to install it first so the dependency solver installs it bundled with python 3.9
# (pypy is not yet compatible with 3.10 and 3.11)
  - pypy
  - "python<3.10"
# NOTE: cwltool needs nodejs for InlineJavascriptRequirement
  - nodejs
  - graphviz
# "Warning: Could not load "/miniconda/bin/../lib/graphviz/libgvplugin_pango.so.6"
#  - It was found, so perhaps one of its dependents was not.  Try ldd."
# See https://github.com/conda-forge/graphviz-feedstock/issues/35#issuecomment-786368065
  - xorg-libxrender
  - shellcheck
# wget and zip cause errors in the setup-miniconda github action on windows.

# scipy is only used for least_squares fitting in the tests, but
# it needs to build binary wheels.
  - scipy
# NOTE: Although wic doesn't have an explicit dependency on numpy, several
# issues arise when numpy is installed as a transitive dependency of matplotlib.
# On linux and macos, using pip to install numpy may cause this error with pytest:
# "Fatal Python error: Illegal instruction"
# So we need to explicitly install numpy using conda.
  - numpy
# The psutil install guide claims that precompiled binary wheels are available,
# and that it isn't necessary to install compilers. This does not appear to be
# correct, so install psutil with conda/mamba so we don't have to install compilers.
  - psutil
# Similarly, toil[cwl] depends on ruamel.yaml.clib for performance.
# Install it with conda/mamba here.
  - ruamel.yaml.clib
# Simiarly, cryptography needs to build binary wheels
