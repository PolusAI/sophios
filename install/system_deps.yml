# scipy is only used for least_squares fitting in the tests, but

# NOTE: Although wic doesn't have an explicit dependency on numpy, several
# issues arise when numpy is installed as a transitive dependency of matplotlib.
# On linux and macos, using pip to install numpy may cause this error with pytest:
# "Fatal Python error: Illegal instruction"
# So we need to explicitly install numpy using conda.
  - numpy
# pandas has a build dependency on oldest-supported-numpy, so
# we have to install both numpy and pandas with conda.
  - pandas
# The psutil install guide claims that precompiled binary wheels are available,
# and that it isn't necessary to install compilers. This does not appear to be
# correct, so install psutil with conda/mamba so we don't have to install compilers.

# Similarly, toil[cwl] depends on ruamel.yaml.clib for performance.
# Install it with conda/mamba here.

# Needs binary PyQt5 dependencies.
